## Important Notes

### YouTube API Key
Replace `YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual YouTube Data API v3 key from:
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

### JWT Secret
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Change `your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production` to a secure random string!

Generate one with:
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```

### Environment Selection
**ALWAYS select all 3 environments** when adding each variable:
- ‚úÖ Production
- ‚úÖ Preview  
- ‚úÖ Development

This ensures consistency across all deployments.

---

## After Adding Variables

For EACH project:

1. **Go to Deployments tab**
2. **Click "..." on latest deployment**
3. **Select "Redeploy"**
4. **Wait for build to complete** (should succeed now with env vars)
5. **Verify** by visiting the project URL

---

## Time Estimate

- Landing: ~2 minutes (4 variables)
- Auth: ~4 minutes (8 variables)
- Player: ~7 minutes (14 variables)
- Admin: ~7 minutes (14 variables)
- Kiosk: ~6 minutes (13 variables)
- Dashboard: ~6 minutes (13 variables)

**Total: ~30-35 minutes** if you copy-paste efficiently

---

## Verification Checklist

After adding all variables and redeploying:

- [ ] djamms-landing deployment successful
- [ ] djamms-auth deployment successful
- [ ] djamms-player deployment successful
- [ ] djamms-admin deployment successful
- [ ] djamms-kiosk deployment successful
- [ ] djamms-dashboard deployment successful

Then move on to custom domain setup! üöÄ
