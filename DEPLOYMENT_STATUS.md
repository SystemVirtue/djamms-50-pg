## 🔄 Deployment Strategy

### Current Setup
**AppWrite Site**: `djamms-unified`  
**Deploy From**: `apps/web` directory  
**Latest Deployment**: 68ec182292141de5d771 (building)  
**Status**: Connected to GitHub (auto-deploy on push)

### Dashboard Deployment

**Option 1: Auto-Deploy (Recommended)**
If the AppWrite site is connected to GitHub with auto-deploy:
- ✅ Your push to `main` will trigger automatic deployment
- ✅ Dashboard fixes will be included automatically
- ⏳ Wait 5-10 minutes for build to complete
- ✅ Check deployment status with: `appwrite sites list`

**Option 2: Manual Deploy**
If you need to deploy manually:
```bash
# From project root
cd apps/web
appwrite sites create-deployment \
  --site-id "djamms-unified" \
  --activate true
```

**Option 3: Separate Dashboard Site (Not Currently Configured)**
Dashboard is in `apps/dashboard` but deployment is from `apps/web`. This suggests either:
- `apps/web` is a unified build that includes all apps
- OR dashboard needs separate site configuration

## 📊 Deployment Checklist

- [x] Code fixed in `apps/dashboard/src/main.tsx`
- [x] Changes committed to git
- [x] Changes pushed to GitHub
- [x] All apps built successfully (`npm run build`)
- [ ] **Check AppWrite deployment status**
- [ ] **Verify dashboard loads without redirect issues**
- [ ] **Test that authentication message appears**
- [ ] **Verify link to login page works**

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Check deployment status**:
   ```bash
   appwrite sites list
   ```
   Look for `latestDeploymentStatus: ready`

2. **If deployment is "building"**:
   - ⏳ Wait 5-10 minutes
   - ✅ Check again

3. **If deployment is "ready"**:
   - ✅ Test dashboard at production URL
   - ✅ Verify no redirect loops
   - ✅ Verify "Authentication Required" message shows

### Testing
4. **Test the fixed dashboard**:
   ```bash
   # Start local dashboard server
   npm run dev:dashboard
   
   # Run tests
   npx playwright test tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts --max-failures=5
   ```

5. **Expected behavior**:
   - ✅ Page loads without timeout
   - ✅ Shows "Authentication Required" message
   - ✅ Provides link to login
   - ✅ Tests can mock auth and access dashboard

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
```bash
# Check deployment logs
appwrite sites list-deployments --site-id "djamms-unified"

# Get specific deployment details
appwrite sites get-deployment \
  --site-id "djamms-unified" \
  --deployment-id <deployment-id>
```

### If dashboard still redirects:
1. Check if old build is cached
2. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Verify you're accessing the correct URL
4. Check browser console for errors
