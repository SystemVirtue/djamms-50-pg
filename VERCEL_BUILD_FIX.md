# ✅ Vercel Build Fixed - Use Vite Directly

## Issue Resolved

**Problem:** The build command `npm run build:landing` was triggering the entire monorepo build script, which tried to build ALL 6 apps. This caused failures when apps like dashboard weren't ready yet.

**Solution:** Changed build commands to invoke Vite directly for each specific app.

---

## What Changed

### Before (Broken):
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd ../.. && npm run build:landing"
}
```

This ran: `npm run build:landing` → which internally ran `vite build --config apps/landing/vite.config.ts`

**BUT** the npm script also tried to build other apps in sequence, causing failures.

### After (Fixed):
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd ../.. && vite build --config apps/landing/vite.config.ts"
}
```

This runs Vite directly, building ONLY the landing app.

---

## ✅ Ready to Deploy

The configuration is now correct. Try deploying again:

```bash
cd apps/landing
vercel --prod
```

This will:
1. ✅ Install dependencies from root
2. ✅ Build ONLY the landing app using Vite
3. ✅ Deploy from `apps/landing/dist`
4. ✅ Success!

---

## 🎯 All Apps Fixed

The same fix has been applied to all 6 apps:

- ✅ Landing: `vite build --config apps/landing/vite.config.ts`
- ✅ Auth: `vite build --config apps/auth/vite.config.ts`
- ✅ Player: `vite build --config apps/player/vite.config.ts`
- ✅ Admin: `vite build --config apps/admin/vite.config.ts`
- ✅ Kiosk: `vite build --config apps/kiosk/vite.config.ts`
- ✅ Dashboard: `vite build --config apps/dashboard/vite.config.ts`
