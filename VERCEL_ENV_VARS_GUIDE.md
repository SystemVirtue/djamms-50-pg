# üîê Adding Environment Variables to Vercel

## Quick Answer: Manual via Dashboard (But We Can Help!)

Yes, environment variables must be added manually through the Vercel dashboard, **BUT** I've created tools to make this much faster:

1. **Copy-paste ready variable lists** (below)
2. **Vercel CLI commands** (experimental, may not work for all variables)
3. **Step-by-step checklist**

---

## üöÄ Fastest Method: Copy-Paste from Below

For each project, you'll:
1. Open: `https://vercel.com/djamms-admins-projects/[project-name]/settings/environment-variables`
2. Click "Add New"
3. Copy-paste the variables from below
4. Select: **Production, Preview, Development** ‚úÖ
5. Click "Save"

## ‚ö° Alternative: Vercel CLI (Experimental)

You can try using the Vercel CLI to add variables programmatically, but this is more complex:

```bash
# Set environment variable via CLI
vercel env add VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT production --scope djamms-admins-projects

# You'd need to run this for each variable, for each app, for each environment
# Not recommended - manual is actually faster!
```

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Checklist

### Landing App (2 minutes)

---

## üîÑ After Adding Variables

You need to **redeploy** each app for the variables to take effect:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-app.sh landing
./scripts/deploy-app.sh auth
./scripts/deploy-app.sh player
./scripts/deploy-app.sh admin
./scripts/deploy-app.sh kiosk
./scripts/deploy-app.sh dashboard
```

Or from Vercel dashboard: **Deployments ‚Üí [latest] ‚Üí ‚ãÆ ‚Üí Redeploy**

---

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Cmd/Ctrl + V` to paste values
- `Tab` to move between fields
- Works on most fields in Vercel dashboard

### Tip 2: Do Production First
- Add all Production variables first
- Then add Preview/Development overrides
- This way you won't forget critical production configs

### Tip 3: Common Variables
These are the same across ALL apps:
- `VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`
- `VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID`
- `VITE_JWT_SECRET`

You can copy-paste these quickly across all 6 apps!

### Tip 4: Verify After Each App
After adding variables, check the "Environment Variables" page shows all of them before moving to the next app.

---

## üö® Important Notes

### Production vs Preview URLs
**Production environment** uses production domains:
- `https://djamms.app`
- `https://auth.djamms.app`
- etc.

**Preview/Development** uses localhost:
- `http://localhost:3000`
- `http://localhost:3002`
- etc.

Make sure you set the right values for each environment!

### Secrets are Encrypted
Once you add variables to Vercel, they're encrypted and secure. Even you won't be able to see the full value again (just edit it).

---

## üìö Why Manual?

Vercel doesn't allow bulk import for security reasons. Each variable needs to be:
1. Explicitly added
2. Assigned to specific environments
3. Confirmed by you

This prevents accidental exposure of secrets and ensures you know exactly what's being deployed.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimate

- **Fast way:** 25-30 minutes (copy-paste from above)
- **Slow way:** 45-60 minutes (typing each variable)

**Recommendation:** Use two browser windows side-by-side:
1. This guide (for copy-paste)
2. Vercel dashboard (for adding variables)

---

## ‚úÖ Completion

After all variables are added and redeployed, your apps will be fully functional in production! üéâ

You can verify by visiting:
- https://djamms.app (landing)
- https://auth.djamms.app (login)
- https://player.djamms.app/player/venue1
- etc.
