# Player Autoplay & Playlist Integration - Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented automatic playlist loading and player autoplay functionality for the DJAMMS player endpoint. The player now automatically loads tracks from the venue's default playlist and starts playing immediately when opened.

## Changes Made

### 1. QueueManagementService Enhancement

**File**: `packages/shared/src/services/QueueManagementService.ts`

**Added Features**:
- **`loadPlaylistIntoQueue(venueId)`**: Private method that:
  - Fetches venue's `defaultPlaylistId` (falls back to 'default_playlist')
  - Loads tracks from the playlist collection
  - Parses JSON track data
  - Converts tracks to `QueueTrack` format
  - Limits to first 50 tracks to avoid overload
  - Handles errors gracefully with fallbacks

- **Enhanced `getQueue(venueId)`**: Now automatically initializes empty queues:
  - Checks if queue is empty (no tracks in main/priority queues, no current track)
  - Automatically loads default playlist tracks when queue is empty
  - Works for both existing and new queues
  - Updates database with loaded tracks
  - Logs initialization progress

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// Load playlist tracks into queue
private async loadPlaylistIntoQueue(venueId: string): Promise<QueueTrack[]>

// Auto-initialize empty queues
async getQueue(venueId: string): Promise<QueueDocument>
```

### 2. PlayerView Autoplay Logic

**File**: `apps/player/src/components/PlayerView.tsx`

**Added Features**:
- **Auto-start State Management**: New `hasAutoStarted` state to prevent multiple autoplay attempts
- **Autoplay Effect**: React useEffect that:
  - Waits for queue to load (checks `isLoading`)
  - Only triggers once per session
  - Checks for available tracks in priority or main queue
  - Uses `getNextTrack()` to properly select first track
  - Uses `playTrack()` to start playback
  - Handles errors gracefully

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// Auto-start first track when queue loads
useEffect(() => {
  if (hasAutoStarted || isLoading || currentTrack) {
    return;
  }

  const hasTracks = priorityQueue.length > 0 || mainQueue.length > 0;
  
  if (hasTracks && getNextTrack && playTrack) {
    setHasAutoStarted(true);
    
    getNextTrack()
      .then((track) => {
        if (track) {
          return playTrack(track);
        }
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.error('[PlayerView] Failed to auto-start:', err);
      });
  }
}, [hasAutoStarted, isLoading, currentTrack, priorityQueue, mainQueue, getNextTrack, playTrack]);
```

## Functionality

### Player Behavior

When a player opens at `/player/venue-001`:

1. **Queue Loading** (automatic):
   - `usePlayerWithSync` hook initializes
   - Calls `QueueManagementService.getQueue(venueId)`
   - Service checks if queue is empty
   - If empty, loads tracks from venue's `defaultPlaylistId`
   - Falls back to `default_playlist` if venue has no playlist configured

2. **Autoplay Trigger** (automatic):
   - PlayerView detects queue has loaded with tracks
   - Checks that no track is currently playing
   - Calls `getNextTrack()` to select first track (priority queue first, then main queue)
   - Calls `playTrack()` to start playback
   - Track begins playing automatically

3. **Queue Management Integration**:
   - Admin queue manager shows all tracks in mainQueue
   - Priority queue shows paid requests (currently 2 tracks)
   - Playlist manager in System Settings shows available playlists

### Database State

**Current Configuration**:
```
Venues: 1
  - venue-001: Venue 001 (playlist: default_playlist)

Playlists: 1
  - default_playlist: Default Playlist (12,878 tracks)

Queues: 1
  - venue-001: 59 main, 2 priority
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Autoplay**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:player
   ```
   - Open http://localhost:3001/player/venue-001
   - Verify first track starts playing automatically
   - Check browser console for autoplay logs

2. **Test Empty Queue Initialization**:
   ```bash
   # Clear the queue in database
   node clear-queue.cjs venue-001
   
   # Open player
   npm run dev:player
   ```
   - Open player
   - Verify queue automatically loads from default_playlist
   - Verify first track starts playing

3. **Test Queue Manager**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:admin
   ```
   - Open http://localhost:3003/admin/venue-001
   - Navigate to Queue Management tab
   - Verify mainQueue shows 59 tracks
   - Verify priorityQueue shows 2 tracks

4. **Test Playlist Manager**:
   - In admin, navigate to System Settings
   - Check Playlist Manager section
   - Verify default_playlist is listed
   - Verify track count shows 12,878 tracks

## Technical Details

### Queue Initialization Flow

```
Player Opens
    ↓
usePlayerWithSync hook initializes
    ↓
useQueueManagement.getQueue(venueId)
    ↓
QueueManagementService.getQueue()
    ↓
Check if queue exists in database
    ↓
If exists: Check if empty
    ↓
If empty or new: loadPlaylistIntoQueue()
    ↓
Fetch venue.defaultPlaylistId
    ↓
Fetch playlist from database
    ↓
Parse tracks JSON
    ↓
Convert to QueueTrack format (limit 50)
    ↓
Update/Create queue document
    ↓
Return queue with tracks
    ↓
PlayerView receives queue
    ↓
Autoplay effect triggers
    ↓
getNextTrack() → playTrack()
    ↓
First track plays automatically
```

## Files Modified

1. `packages/shared/src/services/QueueManagementService.ts`
   - Added `loadPlaylistIntoQueue()` method
   - Enhanced `getQueue()` with auto-initialization

2. `apps/player/src/components/PlayerView.tsx`
   - Added autoplay state management
   - Added autoplay useEffect
   - Integrated with getNextTrack/playTrack

## Dependencies

- **AppWrite Database**: venues, playlists, queues collections
- **React Hooks**: useState, useEffect, useCallback
- **Shared Services**: QueueManagementService, usePlayerWithSync
- **Player Components**: YouTubePlayer, BackgroundSlideshow

## Environment Variables

Required for playlist/queue functionality:
```env
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://syd.cloud.appwrite.io/v1
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=68cc86c3002b27e13947
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=68e57de9003234a84cae
```

## Known Considerations

1. **Track Limit**: Currently limits to first 50 tracks from playlist to avoid overload
   - Can be adjusted in `loadPlaylistIntoQueue()` method
   - Consider pagination for large playlists

2. **Playlist Format**: Expects tracks in specific JSON format
   - Must have: videoId, title, artist, duration, thumbnail
   - Handles missing fields with defaults

3. **Autoplay Policy**: Browser autoplay policies may prevent audio
   - Most browsers allow autoplay with muted audio
   - User interaction may be required in some cases

4. **Master Player**: Currently assumes all players are master
   - TODO: Implement proper master election
   - Only master player should manage queue playback

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Future Enhancements

1. **Master Election**:
   - Implement proper master player selection
   - Only master loads and manages queue
   - Viewer players sync from localStorage

2. **Playlist Rotation**:
   - Option to load different playlists on schedule
   - Rotate through multiple playlists
   - Time-based playlist switching

3. **Queue Preloading**:
   - Load next batch of tracks before current batch ends
   - Infinite scroll queue
   - Dynamic playlist loading

4. **Admin Controls**:
   - Button to manually refresh queue from playlist
   - Select different playlist from dropdown
   - Bulk add tracks to queue

## Success Criteria

✅ **All Completed**:
- [x] Queue automatically loads from default_playlist when empty
- [x] Player automatically starts first track on load
- [x] Falls back to 'default_playlist' if venue has no playlist
- [x] Queue manager shows all tracks
- [x] Playlist manager shows available playlists
- [x] No manual intervention required
- [x] Error handling for missing playlists/tracks
- [x] Console logging for debugging

## Status

**✅ COMPLETE** - All functionality implemented and ready for testing

Player will now:
1. Automatically load playlist tracks when queue is empty
2. Automatically start playing first track on page load
3. Display queue in admin interface
4. Show playlists in playlist manager

Developer can now:
- Open player at any time and music starts immediately
- Manage playlists from admin interface
- View queue status in real-time
- Clear/reset queue and it will auto-reload
