## Production Deployment

### Current Deployment Method

Based on your project configuration, the production apps are deployed to AppWrite Sites:

**Production URLs** (from PRODUCTION_APP_LINKS.md):
- üè† Landing: https://djamms.app
- üîê Auth: https://auth.djamms.app (redirects to www)
- üéÆ Player: https://player.djamms.app
- üë§ Admin: https://admin.djamms.app
- üéµ Kiosk: https://kiosk.djamms.app

### Deployment Options

Since AppWrite Sites configuration shows the site is already deployed, there are two ways to deploy the new changes:

#### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)
If you have GitHub Actions configured, the deployment may be automatic on push to main:
- ‚úÖ Code already pushed to main branch
- Waiting for GitHub Actions to trigger
- Check: https://github.com/SystemVirtue/djamms-50-pg/actions

#### Option 2: Manual AppWrite Site Deployment
Use AppWrite Console to create a new deployment:

1. Go to AppWrite Console: https://syd.cloud.appwrite.io/console/project-68cc86c3002b27e13947/sites
2. Select "DJAMMS Web App" site
3. Click "Create Deployment"
4. Choose deployment source:
   - **From Git**: Connect to GitHub repo and select `main` branch
   - **Manual Upload**: Zip the dist folders and upload

5. Deployment will build and deploy automatically

#### Option 3: AppWrite CLI (Alternative)
```bash
cd functions/appwrite

# Login to AppWrite
npx appwrite login

# Push site deployment
npx appwrite push sites --site-id djamms-web-app

# Or create a new deployment from Git
npx appwrite sites createDeployment --site-id djamms-web-app \
  --activate true \
  --type branch \
  --reference main
```

## What's New in Production

### üéµ Player Autoplay
- Player automatically loads tracks from venue's default playlist
- First track starts playing immediately on page load
- No manual intervention required
- Falls back to 'default_playlist' if venue has none

### üìä Queue Management
- Empty queues automatically populate with 50 tracks from default playlist
- Queue manager shows all tracks in real-time
- Playlist manager integrated in System Settings

### üìö Documentation Cleanup
- 71% reduction in documentation files (140 ‚Üí 40)
- Consolidated guides: QUICKSTART.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, CONFIGURATION.md
- Unified architecture: ARCHITECTURE.md
- Complete navigation: DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md
- Professional README.md

## Testing Production

Once deployed, test the new features:

### 1. Test Player Autoplay
```
1. Open https://player.djamms.app/player/venue-001
2. Should see queue loading
3. First track should start playing automatically
4. Check browser console for autoplay logs
```

### 2. Test Admin Queue Manager
```
1. Open https://admin.djamms.app/admin/venue-001
2. Navigate to Queue Management tab
3. Should see 59+ tracks in main queue
4. Should see 2 tracks in priority queue
```

### 3. Test Empty Queue Initialization
```
1. In admin, clear the entire queue
2. Refresh player page
3. Queue should automatically reload from default_playlist
4. First track should start playing
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback to previous commit:

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD

# Or hard reset (use with caution)
git reset --hard a0f66fd

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main --force
```

## Database State

**Current Production Database**:
- **Venues**: 1 (venue-001)
- **Playlists**: 1 (default_playlist with 12,878 tracks)
- **Queues**: 1 (venue-001 with 59 main + 2 priority)
- **Database**: 68e57de9003234a84cae
- **Region**: Sydney (syd.cloud.appwrite.io)

No database migrations required - changes are backward compatible.

## Environment Variables

All required environment variables are configured in `.env`:
```env
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://syd.cloud.appwrite.io/v1
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=68cc86c3002b27e13947
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=68e57de9003234a84cae
```

No changes to environment variables required.

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

1. **AppWrite Console**: https://syd.cloud.appwrite.io/console
   - Check site deployment status
   - Monitor build logs
   - Check error rates

2. **Browser Console**:
   - Open player in production
   - Check for JavaScript errors
   - Verify autoplay logs appear

3. **Database**:
   - Run `node check-database.cjs` to verify queue state
   - Check that queues are populating correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Deployment**: Check production URLs to ensure deployment succeeded
2. **Test Features**: Run through testing checklist above
3. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for any errors in AppWrite console
4. **User Testing**: Have venue owners test the new autoplay feature
5. **Documentation**: Share DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md with team

## Support

If issues arise:
- Check AppWrite Console for deployment logs
- Review browser console for JavaScript errors
- Check `PLAYER_AUTOPLAY_COMPLETE.md` for technical details
- Review `DOCUMENTATION_CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md` for doc changes
