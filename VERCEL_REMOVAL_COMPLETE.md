# Vercel CI/CD Removal - Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview

Successfully removed all Vercel integration from the DJAMMS project. The project now uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD (testing and builds) and is ready for AppWrite Sites deployment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Deleted Vercel Configuration Files

Removed 7 `vercel.json` files:
```
‚úì vercel.json (root)
‚úì apps/landing/vercel.json
‚úì apps/auth/vercel.json
‚úì apps/player/vercel.json
‚úì apps/admin/vercel.json
‚úì apps/kiosk/vercel.json
‚úì apps/dashboard/vercel.json
```

### 2. Removed Deployment Scripts

Deleted Vercel deployment scripts:
```
‚úì scripts/deploy-vercel.sh
‚úì scripts/create-vercel-secrets.sh
```

### 3. Updated package.json

Removed Vercel npm scripts:
```diff
- "deploy:vercel": "bash scripts/deploy-vercel.sh",
- "deploy:landing": "cd apps/landing && vercel --prod",
- "deploy:auth": "cd apps/auth && vercel --prod",
- "deploy:player": "cd apps/player && vercel --prod",
- "deploy:admin": "cd apps/admin && vercel --prod",
- "deploy:kiosk": "cd apps/kiosk && vercel --prod",
- "deploy:dashboard": "cd apps/dashboard && vercel --prod",
- "deploy:all": "npm run build && npm run deploy:landing && ..."
```

### 4. Cleaned Local Directories

Removed local Vercel configuration directories:
```
‚úì .vercel/ (root)
‚úì apps/landing/.vercel/
‚úì apps/auth/.vercel/
‚úì (and any others)
```

Note: `.vercel` is already in `.gitignore`, so these directories won't be tracked.

## What Remains

### ‚úÖ GitHub Actions CI/CD

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is still active and provides:

1. **Unit Tests** - Runs on every push/PR
2. **E2E Tests** - Runs Playwright tests
3. **Build** - Builds all 6 applications
4. **Artifacts** - Uploads build artifacts and test reports

This workflow does NOT deploy to any platform - it only tests and builds.

### ‚úÖ AppWrite Deployment Ready

The project is now ready for AppWrite Sites deployment through:

**Option 1: AppWrite Console (Manual)**
```
1. Visit: https://syd.cloud.appwrite.io/console/project-68cc86c3002b27e13947/sites
2. Select "DJAMMS Web App" site
3. Create deployment from GitHub main branch
4. AppWrite will build and deploy automatically
```

**Option 2: AppWrite CLI**
```bash
cd functions/appwrite
npx appwrite login
npx appwrite sites createDeployment \
  --site-id djamms-web-app \
  --activate true \
  --type branch \
  --reference main
```

**Option 3: GitHub Actions with AppWrite** (Future)
You could add AppWrite deployment to GitHub Actions:
```yaml
- name: Deploy to AppWrite Sites
  run: |
    npx appwrite login --email ${{ secrets.APPWRITE_EMAIL }} --password ${{ secrets.APPWRITE_PASSWORD }}
    npx appwrite sites createDeployment --site-id djamms-web-app --activate true --type branch --reference main
```

## Git Status

**Commit**: `12f82e7`
```
‚úì Pushed to GitHub main branch
‚úì 11 files changed
‚úì 238 insertions, 222 deletions
```

**Files Changed**:
- Added: `DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md`
- Deleted: 7 `vercel.json` files
- Deleted: 2 deployment scripts
- Modified: `package.json`

## Verification

To verify Vercel has been removed:

### Check Files
```bash
# Should return nothing
find . -name "vercel.json" -not -path "*/node_modules/*"

# Should return nothing
ls -la scripts/*vercel*

# Should return nothing
grep -r "deploy:vercel" package.json
```

### Check Git
```bash
git log -1 --oneline
# Should show: 12f82e7 chore: Remove Vercel CI/CD configuration
```

### Check GitHub
Visit: https://github.com/SystemVirtue/djamms-50-pg

- ‚úì No vercel.json files in repository
- ‚úì No Vercel deployment scripts
- ‚úì GitHub Actions still running for CI/CD

## Next Steps

### 1. Disconnect Vercel Project (Optional)

If the project was connected to Vercel:

1. Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find the DJAMMS project(s)
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Advanced
4. Click "Delete Project"
5. Confirm deletion

This will remove any webhook integrations Vercel may have set up with GitHub.

### 2. Remove GitHub Secrets (Optional)

If there were Vercel-specific GitHub secrets:

1. Visit: https://github.com/SystemVirtue/djamms-50-pg/settings/secrets/actions
2. Remove any secrets like:
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN`
   - `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
   - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
   - etc.

### 3. Deploy to AppWrite

Now deploy the latest changes to AppWrite Sites:

```bash
cd functions/appwrite
npx appwrite sites createDeployment \
  --site-id djamms-web-app \
  --activate true \
  --type branch \
  --reference main
```

Or use the AppWrite Console as described above.

## Production URLs

After AppWrite deployment, your apps will be available at:

- üè† Landing: https://djamms.app
- üîê Auth: https://auth.djamms.app
- üéÆ Player: https://player.djamms.app
- üë§ Admin: https://admin.djamms.app
- üéµ Kiosk: https://kiosk.djamms.app
- üìä Dashboard: https://dashboard.djamms.app (if configured)

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ Cleaner Codebase
- No vendor-specific configuration files
- Simpler project structure
- Less maintenance overhead

### ‚úÖ Single Platform
- All infrastructure in AppWrite
- Database + Auth + Storage + Sites in one place

## Rollback Plan

If you need to restore Vercel integration:

```bash
# Checkout previous commit
git checkout 8a0196d

# Or revert the removal
git revert 12f82e7

# Push to restore
git push origin main
```
