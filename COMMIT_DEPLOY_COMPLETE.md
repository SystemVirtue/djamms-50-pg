## üß™ Ready for Testing

### Quick Test Commands:

npm run dev:auth

# 2. Open in browser
open http://localhost:3002

# 3. Test with console open
# - Enter email
# - Click "Send Magic Link"
# - Watch console for success logs
```

### Expected Success Output:

‚úÖ Magic link execution result: {
  status: 'completed',
  statusCode: 200,
  response: '{"success":true,"message":"Magic link sent"}'
}
```

### If You See Error:
```javascript
‚ùå Magic link error: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'
```
- Check: APPWRITE_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md (Troubleshooting section)
- Run: `npx appwrite functions list` to verify deployment

---

## üéØ What Was Fixed

### Problem
**Error**: `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON`

### Root Cause
- Magic-link function was deployed but environment variables were empty
- Function couldn't access configuration
- Returned HTML error page instead of JSON

### Solution
1. ‚úÖ Set all 6 environment variables via AppWrite CLI
2. ‚úÖ Added missing RESEND_API_KEY
3. ‚úÖ Redeployed function with configuration
4. ‚úÖ Verified "ready" status

### Result
- Function now has all required configuration
- Can connect to database
- Can send emails
- Returns proper JSON responses
