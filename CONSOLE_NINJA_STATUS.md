**Warnings**: 0 ✅  
**Status**: All apps running cleanly

## 🎯 How to View Console Output

### Method 1: Console Ninja Panel (Recommended)
1. Open VS Code Output panel: `View > Output` or `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+U`
2. Select "Console Ninja" from the dropdown menu
3. Open any app URL in your browser
4. Watch console output appear in real-time!

### Method 2: Inline in Code
Console Ninja shows output directly next to the code that generated it:
- Look for gray comment-style annotations
- Hover over them to see full details
- Click to expand objects and arrays

### Method 3: Using VS Code Tools
You can also query Console Ninja programmatically:

**Get Runtime Errors:**
```typescript
// In VS Code command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P):
> Console Ninja: Runtime Errors
```

**Get Runtime Logs:**
```typescript
> Console Ninja: Runtime Logs
```

**Get Logs by Location:**
```typescript
> Console Ninja: Runtime Logs By Location
```

## 📊 Testing the Setup

### Step 1: Open Apps in Browser
Open these URLs in Chrome/Edge/Firefox:

```bash
# Landing Page
http://localhost:3000/

# Player App (Main component)
http://localhost:3001/player/venue1

# Auth Login
http://localhost:3002/auth/login

# Admin Dashboard
http://localhost:3003/admin/venue1

# Kiosk Interface
http://localhost:3004/kiosk/venue1
```

### Step 2: Watch Console Ninja
As you interact with the apps, you'll see:
- `console.log()` output in real-time
- Network requests (especially AppWrite API calls)
- Component renders
- State changes
- Errors and warnings
- Performance metrics

### Step 3: Add Debug Logs
Try adding a console log to test:

```typescript
// In apps/player/src/hooks/usePlayerManager.ts
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('🎵 Player initialized for venue:', venueId);
  initializePlayer();
  return () => {
    cleanup();
  };
}, [venueId]);
```

Save the file, and you'll see the log appear in Console Ninja when you refresh the player page!

## 🐛 Monitoring for Issues

### Expected Console Output

Based on your apps, you should see logs like:

**Player App:**
- "Player initialized for venue: venue1"
- "Master player registration requested"
- "Queue loaded from server"
- "Real-time subscription started"
- YouTube player ready events

**Admin Dashboard:**
- "AppWrite connection established"
- "Subscribed to queue updates"
- "Queue state updated"
- Countdown timer ticks

**Auth App:**
- "Magic link send requested"
- "Redirecting to admin dashboard"
- AppWrite API responses

### Common Issues to Watch For

Console Ninja will highlight these issues:

1. **AppWrite Connection Errors**
   - Look for: "Failed to fetch" or "Network error"
   - Solution: Check `.env` configuration

2. **Missing Environment Variables**
   - Look for: "Missing required environment variables"
   - Solution: Verify all VITE_* variables in `.env`

3. **YouTube Player Errors**
   - Look for: "YT is not defined" or "Invalid video ID"
   - Solution: Check YouTube API integration

4. **Authentication Failures**
   - Look for: "Magic link callback failed"
   - Solution: Deploy AppWrite magic-link function

5. **Real-time Sync Issues**
   - Look for: "Failed to subscribe" or "Channel error"
   - Solution: Check AppWrite Realtime permissions

## 🔧 Automated Monitoring Script

You can also use the automated monitoring script:

```bash
# Monitor all apps for console errors
node scripts/console-monitor.mjs
```

This script will:
- Open each app in a headless browser
- Capture all console output
- Report errors and warnings
- Provide a summary report

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Filter Output
Console Ninja can get noisy. Use filters:
- Click the funnel icon in Console Ninja panel

- Filter by log level (errors only, warnings, etc.)

### 2. Object Inspection
When you see an object in Console Ninja:
- Click to expand it
- Right-click to copy value
- Shift+click to collapse all

### 3. Performance Monitoring
Console Ninja shows:
- Render counts per component
- Re-render reasons
- Network request timing
- Memory usage

### 4. Jump to Source
Click any log entry to:
- Jump to the source code line
- See the context around the log
- Edit and save to see changes immediately

### 5. Export Logs
Need to share logs?
- Right-click in Console Ninja panel
- Select "Copy All Logs"
