# üîß Resend Configuration Status

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Environment Variables Set But Function Not Using Them

---

## üîç Current Situation

I've tested the magic-link function and found that **the RESEND_API_KEY is not being used by the function** even though you've added it to the AppWrite console.

### Test Results

```bash
curl test to function execution 68e6dd5223c0b45e7469
Status: completed
Logs: RESEND_API_KEY not configured - skipping email send
```

**This means:** The environment variables are set in the console, but the **function needs to be redeployed** for them to take effect.

---

## ‚úÖ What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Redeploy the Magic Link Function

You have two options:

#### Option A: Redeploy from AppWrite Console (Recommended - 30 seconds)

1. Go to https://cloud.appwrite.io
2. Navigate to your project: **djamms-prototype**
3. Go to **Functions** ‚Üí **magic-link**
4. Click on **Deployments** tab
5. Find the latest deployment (ID: `68e6d45b68433e157a49`)
6. Click the **‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢** menu next to it
7. Click **Redeploy**
8. Wait for deployment to complete (~30 seconds)

#### Option B: Redeploy via CLI (1 minute)

```bash
cd /Users/mikeclarkin/DJAMMS_50_page_prompt/functions/appwrite/functions/magic-link
appwrite deploy function
```

## üß™ After Redeployment: Test Email Sending

### Quick Test (30 seconds)

Run this command to test if emails are now being sent:

```bash
cd /Users/mikeclarkin/DJAMMS_50_page_prompt
node tests/test-email-sending.mjs
```

### What to Expect

If successful, you should see:
```
‚úÖ PASS: Magic link created successfully
üìß ‚úÖ Email sent successfully via Resend!
üéâ SUCCESS: Check mike@djamms.app for the magic link email!
```

Then check your email inbox (and spam folder) for the magic link email.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issue: Resend Domain Not Verified

Even after redeploying, emails might not send if the domain isn't verified in Resend.

### Check Domain Verification

1. Log into https://resend.com
2. Go to **Domains**
3. Look for **djamms.app**
4. Status should be **Verified** (green checkmark)

### If Domain Shows "Not Verified"

You need to add DNS records to Porkbun:

1. In Resend, click on **djamms.app** domain
2. Copy the two TXT records shown:
   ```
   Type: TXT
   Host: _resend
   Value: resend-verification-XXXXXXXX
   
   Type: TXT
   Host: resend._domainkey
   Value: p=MII... (long string)
   ```

3. Log into https://porkbun.com
4. Go to **djamms.app** ‚Üí **DNS Records**
5. Add both TXT records
6. Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation
7. Return to Resend and click **Verify**

### Verify DNS Records

```bash
# Check if records exist
dig _resend.djamms.app TXT +short
dig resend._domainkey.djamms.app TXT +short
```

If both commands return values, DNS is configured correctly.

## üìã Troubleshooting Checklist

After redeploying the function, if emails still don't send:

### 1. Check Function Environment Variables

In AppWrite console:
- [ ] Functions ‚Üí magic-link ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- [ ] Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` exists and starts with `re_`
- [ ] Verify `SMTP_FROM` exists (e.g., `DJAMMS <noreply@djamms.app>`)

### 2. Check Deployment Status

- [ ] Latest deployment status is **Active** (green)
- [ ] No errors in deployment logs

### 3. Check Resend Dashboard

- [ ] Domain `djamms.app` shows as **Verified**
- [ ] API key is **Active** (not deleted)
- [ ] Check **Logs** tab for any email attempts

### 4. Test Again

```bash
# Test with curl
curl -X POST "https://syd.cloud.appwrite.io/v1/functions/68e5a317003c42c8bb6a/executions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Appwrite-Project: 68cc86c3002b27e13947" \
  -d '{"body":"{\"action\":\"create\",\"email\":\"YOUR_EMAIL@example.com\"}"}' 

# Then check the logs of that execution
curl -X GET "https://syd.cloud.appwrite.io/v1/functions/68e5a317003c42c8bb6a/executions/EXECUTION_ID" \
  -H "X-Appwrite-Project: 68cc86c3002b27e13947" \
  -H "X-Appwrite-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Look for one of these messages in logs:
- ‚úÖ "Email sent successfully" ‚Üí Email was sent!
- ‚ùå "RESEND_API_KEY not configured" ‚Üí Function not redeployed
- ‚ùå "Error sending email" ‚Üí Check error details
