## What's Happening Now

### Vercel Auto-Deployment Should Trigger

If your Vercel projects are connected to GitHub:
1. ‚úÖ Vercel detects new commits on main branch
2. üîÑ Starts building auth app (2-3 minutes)
3. üöÄ Deploys to `auth.djamms.app`
4. ‚úÖ Magic links will work!

---

## Monitor Deployment

### Check Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Look for your **auth** project (deployment URL: `auth.djamms.app`)
3. You should see:
   ```
   üîÑ Building...
   Commit: Fix auth routes - remove /auth prefix from paths
   Branch: main
   ```

### Deployment Timeline

- **0-30 seconds**: Vercel detects push
- **30 seconds - 2 minutes**: Building
- **2-3 minutes**: Deployed ‚úÖ

## After Deployment Completes

2. Enter email: `mike.clarkin@icloud.com`
3. Click "Send Magic Link"

**Expected URL in email**:
```
https://auth.djamms.app/callback?secret=...&userId=mike.clarkin%40icloud.com
```

### Test 3: Click Magic Link

Click the link in your email.

**Expected behavior**:
1. ‚úÖ Loads callback page (not 404!)
2. ‚úÖ Shows "Verifying..." or similar

## If Vercel Doesn't Auto-Deploy

### Manual Deployment Steps

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find **auth** project
3. Click **Deployments** tab
4. Look for latest deployment
5. If no new deployment started:
   - Click **‚ãØ** (three dots)
   - Click **Redeploy**
   - Select **Use existing Build Cache** ‚ùå (uncheck this!)
   - Click **Redeploy**

---

## Verification Checklist

## Current Issue Analysis

### Problem URLs You're Seeing

1. **From `djamms.app`**:
   ```
   https://djamms.app/auth/callback?secret=...
   Result: 404 NOT_FOUND ‚ùå
   ```
   - **Issue**: Wrong domain (root instead of auth subdomain)
   - **Also**: Wrong path (`/auth/callback` instead of `/callback`)

2. **From `auth.djamms.app`**:
   ```
   https://auth.djamms.app/callback?secret=...
   Result: 404 NOT_FOUND ‚ùå
   ```
   - **Issue**: Route doesn't exist yet (old code deployed)
   - **Fix**: Need new deployment with updated routes

### Why Both Exist?

You have login forms on **both domains**:
- `djamms.app` (landing page)
- `auth.djamms.app` (auth app)

Both are calling the Appwrite magic link function, but they're passing different `redirectUrl` values based on their local environment variables.

The **auth app** is passing the correct URL, but the **landing page** might be passing the wrong one.

---

## After Fix Deploys

### `auth.djamms.app` Magic Links ‚úÖ
```
URL in email: https://auth.djamms.app/callback
Result: WORKS! ‚úÖ
```

### `djamms.app` Magic Links ‚ö†Ô∏è
```
URL in email: https://djamms.app/auth/callback
Result: Still 404 ‚ùå
```

**Solution for landing page**:
- Either remove the login form from landing page
- Or add environment variable for landing app too
- Or redirect landing login to auth app

---

## Recommended: Use Auth App Only

For now, **only use the auth app** for magic links:
- ‚úÖ Go to: https://auth.djamms.app
- ‚úÖ Request magic link from there
- ‚úÖ Will work after deployment!

**Don't use** the landing page login form until we fix that too.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Wait 3 minutes** for Vercel deployment
2. **Check deployment** at https://vercel.com/dashboard
3. **Test magic link** from `auth.djamms.app`
4. **Celebrate** when it works! üéâ

---

## Need Help?

If deployment doesn't start automatically:
1. Check if GitHub integration is enabled in Vercel
2. Or manually redeploy from Vercel dashboard
3. Make sure you're redeploying the **auth** project specifically

If still getting 404 after deployment:
1. Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check deployment logs for errors
3. Verify the deployment is for the auth project
4. Check the deployed commit hash matches f00b112

---

## Summary

‚úÖ All code fixes committed and pushed  
üîÑ Vercel should auto-deploy now (2-3 minutes)  
‚è≥ Wait for deployment to complete  
üß™ Test magic link from auth.djamms.app  
üéâ Should work perfectly!

**Status**: WAITING FOR VERCEL DEPLOYMENT
