## 🔧 Current Issue: Hosts File Override

### Problem

Your `/etc/hosts` file contains:
```
127.0.0.1 player.djamms.app
127.0.0.1 admin.djamms.app
```

### Impact

- curl and browsers connect to localhost instead of Vercel
- SSL tests fail with "Connection Refused"
- Production apps are inaccessible from your machine
- **Other users can access these domains fine** (only affects your local machine)

### Solution

Run the prepared fix script:

```bash
# Review the script first (optional)
cat scripts/fix-hosts-file.sh

# Run the fix (requires sudo password)
sudo ./scripts/fix-hosts-file.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. ✅ Creates timestamped backup of /etc/hosts
2. ✅ Removes the two problematic lines
3. ✅ Flushes DNS cache
4. ✅ Verifies the fix
5. ✅ Provides restoration instructions if needed

**Time required:** 1 minute

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)

**Step 1: Fix Hosts File**
```bash
sudo ./scripts/fix-hosts-file.sh
```

**Step 2: Verify Fix**
```bash
# Should return 200 for both
curl -I https://player.djamms.app
curl -I https://admin.djamms.app
```

**Step 3: Run Full Test Suite**
```bash
./scripts/test-deployment.sh
```

**Expected Result:** 9/9 tests passing ✅

### After 100% Tests Pass

**Step 4: Browser Testing**
1. Open https://djamms.app (landing page)
2. Click "Login" button
3. Verify redirect to auth.djamms.app
4. Test magic link email generation
5. Check player.djamms.app loads
6. Check admin.djamms.app loads
7. Check kiosk.djamms.app loads
8. Check dashboard.djamms.app loads

**Step 5: CORS Testing**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Visit each app
3. Check for CORS errors
4. Verify API calls to AppWrite work
5. Test real-time subscriptions (if implemented)

**Step 6: Functional Testing**
1. Test authentication flow end-to-end
2. Test YouTube search and playback
3. Test queue management
4. Test player controls
5. Test venue selection
6. Test admin functions
