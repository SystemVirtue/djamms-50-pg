## Running Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all unit tests
npm test

# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Watch mode (unit tests)
npm run test:unit:watch

# Interactive E2E mode
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### Test Execution Time (Estimated)
- Unit Tests: ~5 seconds
- E2E Kiosk: ~2 minutes
- E2E Admin: ~4 minutes
- E2E Player: ~5 minutes
- **Total**: ~11-12 minutes

## Test Scenarios Covered

### 1. Complete User Flow
```
Kiosk → Queue → Player → Admin Control
Customer searches → Requests song → Master plays → Admin manages
```

### 2. Multi-Device Synchronization
```
Player 1 (Master) ← Sync → Player 2 (Backup) ← Sync → Admin
State changes propagate instantly across all devices
```

### 3. Master Failover
```
Player A (Master) crashes → Player B detects → Player B becomes Master
Playback continues without interruption
```

### 4. Real-Time Command Flow
```
Admin clicks pause → Command created → Player receives → Executes → State updates
All viewers see paused state within 100ms
```

### 5. Crossfading Playback
```
Track A (iframe 1) → 10s crossfade → Track B (iframe 2)
Seamless audio transition without gaps
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions (Recommended)
```yaml
- name: Unit Tests
  run: npm test

- name: E2E Tests
  run: npm run test:e2e

- name: Upload Reports
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: test-reports
    path: |
      playwright-report/
      coverage/
```

### Test Reports
