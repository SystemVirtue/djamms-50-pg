## The Schema Change (Simple Explanation)

### Current Problem

Data is scattered across multiple places:
```
users.venueId = "venue-001"        (location 1)
users.venues = ["venue-001"]       (location 2)
venues.staffIds = ["user-456"]     (location 3)
```

This causes:
- Multiple queries to get user's venue
- Synchronization issues
- Complex permission checks
- Harder to maintain

### Solution

Put everything in ONE place - the venue:
```
venues.users = [
  {
    userId: "user-123",
    email: "owner@bar.com",
    role: "owner",
    addedAt: "2025-01-12T10:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    userId: "user-456",  
    email: "staff@bar.com",
    role: "staff",
    addedAt: "2025-01-13T14:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

This enables:
- Single query to get venue + users
- Automatic consistency
- Simple permission checks
- Easy to understand

## Your Next Step

### Option 1: Test Migration (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
cd /Users/mikeclarkin/DJAMMS_50_page_prompt
node scripts/migrate-to-venue-centric.mjs --dry-run
```

**What this does**:
- Shows exactly what will change
- Creates backup file
- **Makes NO changes** to database
- Takes 2 minutes

**You'll see**:
```
Venues Migrated:       5
Users Added to Venues: 12
Users Cleaned:         7
Errors:                0

Backup Location:       /backups/backup-2025-10-15...
Mode:                  DRY RUN (no changes made)
```

### Option 2: Run Full Migration

```bash
node scripts/migrate-to-venue-centric.mjs
```

**What this does**:
- Creates backup automatically
- Asks for confirmation
- Migrates all data
- Verifies success
- Takes 5-10 minutes

### Option 3: Review Documentation

Open and read:
1. `VENUE_CENTRIC_SUMMARY.md` - Quick overview
2. `VENUE_CENTRIC_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Step-by-step guide  
3. `VENUE_CENTRIC_SCHEMA.md` - Complete reference

## Safety Guarantees

### 1. Backup Before Everything ‚úÖ

Every migration automatically creates backup:
- Complete snapshot of all data
- Saved to `backups/` folder
- Timestamped filename
- JSON format (readable)

### 2. Dry-Run Testing ‚úÖ

Test migration with `--dry-run`:
- See what will change
- No database modifications
- Verify data integrity
- Catch potential issues

### 3. Automatic Verification ‚úÖ

After migration:
- Checks venues have users[] array
- Checks users don't have old fields
- Validates data integrity
- Reports any issues

### 4. Easy Rollback ‚úÖ

If needed, restore from backup:
- Use backup file
- Run rollback script
- Or manually restore in Console
- **Zero data loss**
