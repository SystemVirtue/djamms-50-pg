# Vercel Environment Variables - Optimized Copy-Paste Format

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategy: Copy Common Variables Once, Paste 6 Times

Instead of individually adding 70+ variables, we'll:
1. Add the **10 common variables** to all 6 projects (copy-paste 6x)
2. Add **app-specific variables** only where needed

**Time savings: 30-35 minutes â†’ 15-20 minutes**

---

## Step 1: Common Variables (Add to ALL 6 projects)

Copy these 10 variables and paste into each project. Open all 6 environment variable pages in tabs:

- [djamms-landing](https://vercel.com/djamms-admins-projects/djamms-landing/settings/environment-variables)
- [djamms-auth](https://vercel.com/djamms-admins-projects/djamms-auth/settings/environment-variables)
- [djamms-player](https://vercel.com/djamms-admins-projects/djamms-player/settings/environment-variables)
- [djamms-admin](https://vercel.com/djamms-admins-projects/djamms-admin/settings/environment-variables)
- [djamms-kiosk](https://vercel.com/djamms-admins-projects/djamms-kiosk/settings/environment-variables)
- [djamms-dashboard](https://vercel.com/djamms-admins-projects/djamms-dashboard/settings/environment-variables)
