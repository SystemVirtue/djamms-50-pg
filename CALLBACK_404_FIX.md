# 🔧 Callback 404 Fix - Complete Guide

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

**Magic link works, but callback fails with 404:**
```
URL: https://www.djamms.app/auth/callback?userId=...&secret=...
Error: "Page not found. router_path_not_found"
```

## 🎯 **Root Cause**

**AppWrite Sites needs SPA (Single Page Application) configuration**

React Router handles `/auth/callback` client-side, but AppWrite tries to find a physical file called `/auth/callback` which doesn't exist. We need to configure AppWrite to serve `index.html` for ALL routes.

---

## ✅ **Solution: Configure SPA Fallback**

### **Status:**
- ✅ `fallbackFile: index.html` is configured
- 🔄 New deployment in progress to activate it
- ⏰ Waiting for deployment ID: `68e7e5c95ca1d7f21248`

### **What We Did:**
```bash
1. Set fallback file:
   appwrite sites update --fallback-file "index.html"

2. Set adapter:
   --adapter "static"

3. Deploy with settings:
   appwrite sites create-deployment --activate true
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing Steps (After Deployment)**

### **1. Test Fallback is Working:**
```bash
# This should return HTML (index.html), not 404
curl -I https://www.djamms.app/any-random-route-123

# Expected: HTTP/2 200
# Current: HTTP/2 404 (will change after deployment)
```

### **2. Test Callback Route:**
```bash
curl -I https://www.djamms.app/auth/callback

# Expected: HTTP/2 200 (serves index.html, React Router handles routing)
```

### **3. Test Magic Link:**
1. Visit: https://www.djamms.app/auth
2. Enter email
3. Click "Send Magic Link"
4. Check email
5. Click link → Should work! ✅

---

## 📋 **Alternative Fix (If Still Not Working)**

If the deployment doesn't fix it, we can add a `_redirects` file:

### **Create `apps/web/public/_redirects`:**
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

This tells AppWrite to serve `index.html` for all routes with a 200 status (not a redirect).

### **Then rebuild and redeploy:**
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run build
cd ..
appwrite sites create-deployment --site-id "djamms-unified" --code "apps/web/dist" --activate true
```

---

## 🌐 **Root Domain Configuration (djamms.app → www.djamms.app)**

### **In Porkbun Console:**

**Option A: URL Forward (Easiest):**
```
Go to: Domain → djamms.app → URL Forwarding
Add:
  From: @ (root domain)
  To: https://www.djamms.app
  Type: 301 (Permanent Redirect)
  Include Path: YES
```

**Option B: ALIAS Record (Better for DNS):**
```
Go to: Domain → djamms.app → DNS Records
Add:
  TYPE: ALIAS (or ANAME if ALIAS not available)
  HOST: @
  VALUE: www.djamms.app
  TTL: 600
```

**Why This Works:**
- Users visit `djamms.app`
- DNS/redirect sends them to `www.djamms.app`
- Magic link uses `www.djamms.app` (matches CNAME)
- Everything works seamlessly!

---

## 🔍 **Deployment Monitoring**

### **Check Status:**
```bash
appwrite sites get --site-id "djamms-unified" | grep -E "(live|latestDeploymentStatus|fallbackFile)"
```

### **Expected Output (When Ready):**
```
live : true
latestDeploymentStatus : ready
fallbackFile : index.html
```

### **Then Test:**
```bash
# Should return HTML, not 404
curl -s https://www.djamms.app/auth/callback | head -20
```

## 📊 **Configuration Summary**

| Setting | Value | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Framework** | react | ✅ Set |
| **Adapter** | static | ✅ Set |
| **Fallback File** | index.html | ✅ Set |
| **Output Directory** | . | ✅ Set |
| **Active Deployment** | 68e7e3286103759a86e4 | ✅ Live |
| **New Deployment** | 68e7e5c95ca1d7f21248 | 🔄 Waiting |
| **Magic Redirect URL** | https://www.djamms.app/auth/callback | ✅ Set |

---

## 🎯 **Current Status**

### **What Works:**
- ✅ www.djamms.app loads correctly
- ✅ /auth page displays magic link form
- ✅ Magic link email is sent
- ✅ Email is received with correct URL

### **What Doesn't Work (Yet):**
- ❌ /auth/callback returns 404
- ⏰ Waiting for deployment with SPA fallback

### **ETA:**
- Deployment typically takes 2-5 minutes
- Current deployment started: 16:41
- Should be ready by: 16:43-16:46

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Wait for deployment** (ID: 68e7e5c95ca1d7f21248) to complete
2. **Test callback route**: `curl -I https://www.djamms.app/auth/callback`
3. **If 200 OK**: Test full magic link flow
4. **If still 404**: Add `_redirects` file (see Alternative Fix above)
5. **Configure root domain**: Add URL forward or ALIAS in Porkbun

---

## 🐛 **If Still Having Issues**

### **Check Deployment Status:**
```bash
appwrite sites get-deployment --site-id "djamms-unified" --deployment-id "68e7e5c95ca1d7f21248"
```

### **Check Build Logs:**
```bash
appwrite sites get-deployment --site-id "djamms-unified" --deployment-id "68e7e5c95ca1d7f21248" | grep -A 20 "buildLogs"
```

### **Force New Deployment:**
```bash
# Add _redirects file first (see Alternative Fix)
cd apps/web
npm run build
cd ..
appwrite sites create-deployment --site-id "djamms-unified" --code "apps/web/dist" --activate true
```

## 📝 **Technical Explanation**

### **How SPAs Work:**
```
1. Browser requests: /auth/callback
2. Server looks for: /auth/callback file → NOT FOUND
3. Without fallback: Return 404 ❌
4. With fallback: Return index.html instead ✅
5. React loads: index.html
6. React Router: Sees /auth/callback in URL
7. React Router: Renders AuthCallback component
8. Success! ✅
```

### **Why It's Failing Now:**
- AppWrite doesn't know to serve index.html for all routes
- It tries to find literal files matching the URL path
- `/auth/callback` file doesn't exist
- Returns 404

### **Why It Will Work:**
- `fallbackFile: index.html` tells AppWrite
- "If file not found, serve index.html instead"
- React Router takes over from there
- All routes work!

**⏰ Waiting for deployment to complete...**

**Check status with:**
```bash
appwrite sites get --site-id "djamms-unified" | grep latestDeploymentStatus
```

**When it says `ready`, try the magic link again!** 🎉
