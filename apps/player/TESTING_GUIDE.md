## Prerequisites

### 1. Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in the appropriate locations:

**`/apps/player/.env`:**
```bash
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=main-db
VITE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
```

### 2. AppWrite Database Schema

Ensure these collections exist:

**Collection: `queues`**
- venueId (string, required)
- videoId (string, required)
- title (string, required)
- artist (string, required)
- duration (number, required)
- thumbnailUrl (string)
- position (number)
- isPriority (boolean)
- addedAt (datetime)
- requestedBy (string, optional)

**Collection: `player_instances`** (NEW)
- playerId (string, document ID)
- venueId (string, required, indexed)
- deviceId (string, required)
- status (string, required) - values: 'active', 'idle', 'offline'
- lastHeartbeat (integer, required) - timestamp in milliseconds
- expiresAt (integer, required, indexed) - timestamp in milliseconds
- userAgent (string)
- createdAt (datetime)

### 3. AppWrite Indexes

Create these indexes for performance:

**`player_instances` collection:**
- Index 1: venueId (ASC), status (ASC), expiresAt (DESC)
- Index 2: expiresAt (ASC), status (ASC)

## Dev Tools

### Browser Console Logs

The player outputs detailed logs:

```javascript
// Master election
"Master status changed: true"

// Queue updates
"Queue updated: { priorityQueue: [...], mainQueue: [...] }"

// Heartbeat
"Heartbeat sent at: 1697123456789"

// Player errors
"YouTube player error: Video not found"
```

### AppWrite Console Monitoring

**Watch player_instances:**
```
venueId: test-venue-id
deviceId: player_1697123456_abc123def
status: active
lastHeartbeat: 1697123456789
expiresAt: 1697123471789 (15s ahead)
```

**Watch queues:**
```
Documents should decrease as tracks are played
position values should be sequential
isPriority=true tracks should be processed first
```

### localStorage Keys

```javascript
// Device ID
localStorage.getItem('djamms_device_id')
// => "player_1697123456_abc123def"

// Master status
localStorage.getItem('isMasterPlayer_test-venue-id')
// => "true"

// Now playing
localStorage.getItem('djamms_now_playing_test-venue-id')
// => "{\"videoId\":\"...\",\"title\":\"...\"}"

// Volume
localStorage.getItem('djamms_volume')
// => "75"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to initialize player"

**Causes:**
- Missing environment variables
- Invalid AppWrite credentials
- Network connectivity issues

**Solutions:**
1. Check `.env` file exists and has correct values
2. Verify AppWrite project ID and endpoint
3. Check browser network tab for failed requests
4. Ensure AppWrite database exists and collections are created

### Issue: "Player is active on another device" (when it shouldn't be)

**Causes:**
- Previous player instance didn't cleanup properly
- Master heartbeat stuck in database
- Time sync issues

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 15 seconds for master timeout
2. Manually delete player_instances document in AppWrite console
3. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
4. Ensure system clock is correct

### Issue: YouTube player not loading

**Causes:**
- Invalid YouTube API key
- Video not embeddable
- CORS issues
- Ad blocker interference

**Solutions:**
1. Verify VITE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY is set
2. Try different videoId
3. Disable ad blockers
4. Check browser console for YouTube IFrame API errors
5. Verify YouTube IFrame API script loads: `window.YT`

### Issue: No crossfade between tracks

**Causes:**
- Only one iframe initialized
- JavaScript error during transition
- Volume set to 0

**Solutions:**
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify both player iframes exist in DOM
3. Check volume setting
4. Ensure track has valid duration

### Issue: Queue not updating in real-time

**Causes:**
- AppWrite Realtime not connected
- Incorrect venueId
- Collection permissions

**Solutions:**
1. Check AppWrite console - Realtime connections
2. Verify venueId matches between player and kiosk
3. Check collection permissions (read access)
4. Check browser console for subscription errors

### Issue: Tracks skipping too fast

**Causes:**
- Video playback error
- Invalid duration
- autoplay blocked by browser

**Solutions:**
1. Check console for player errors
2. Verify track duration is correct
3. Enable autoplay in browser settings
4. User interaction required - add click handler

## Summary

The Player endpoint now features:

1. **Dual YouTube iframes** for seamless crossfading between tracks
2. **Master election** with heartbeat-based expiry (5s heartbeat, 15s timeout)
3. **Device ID persistence** for reconnection as master
4. **Real-time sync** with AppWrite for queue updates
5. **Background slideshow** showing upcoming tracks
6. **Full playback controls** (play/pause/skip/volume)
7. **Automatic progression** through queue
8. **Conflict resolution** - only one master per venue

The implementation is production-ready and fully integrated with the Kiosk endpoint for end-to-end functionality.
