# Task 5 Complete: Player Endpoint - Dual YouTube iframes

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Successfully implemented the Player endpoint with dual YouTube iframe architecture, master election, and real-time synchronization.

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. **PlayerService** (`packages/shared/src/services/PlayerService.ts`)
Master election service with heartbeat-based expiry system:
- `requestMaster()` - Request to become master player
- `updateHeartbeat()` - Update heartbeat every 5 seconds
- `startHeartbeat()` - Start automatic heartbeat interval
- `stopHeartbeat()` - Stop heartbeat interval
- `releaseMaster()` - Release master status gracefully
- `checkMasterStatus()` - Verify current master status
- `cleanupExpiredMasters()` - Remove expired instances

**Key Features:**
- 5-second heartbeat interval
- 15-second timeout for master expiry
- Device ID-based identification
- Automatic takeover after expiry
- Graceful release on cleanup

### 2. **YouTubePlayer Component** (`packages/shared/src/components/YouTubePlayer.tsx`)
Dual iframe player with crossfading capability:
- Two YouTube IFrame API players

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Master Election Flow

```
1. Player opens
   ↓
2. Generate/retrieve device ID (localStorage)
   ↓
3. Query player_instances for active master
   ↓
4a. No master → Register as master
    ↓
    Start heartbeat (every 5s)
    ↓
    Load queue
    ↓
    Subscribe to real-time updates

4b. Master exists → Show busy screen
    ↓
    Display current master info
    ↓
    Offer retry button
```

### Crossfade Flow

```
Track A playing (primary iframe)
   ↓
Track ending detected
   ↓
Load Track B in secondary iframe (hidden)
   ↓
Start crossfade (3 seconds):
  - Primary: 100% → 0% volume
  - Secondary: 0% → 100% volume
   ↓
Switch active player
   ↓
Track B now primary (visible)
   ↓
Track A now secondary (hidden, ready for next)
```

### Real-time Sync Flow

```
Kiosk adds track
   ↓
AppWrite queues collection updated
   ↓
AppWrite Realtime emits event
   ↓
Player subscription receives event
   ↓
usePlayerManager calls loadQueue()
   ↓
PlayerView updates "Up Next" display
   ↓
User sees new track immediately
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### New Collection: `player_instances`

```typescript
{
  $id: string;              // Document ID (playerId)
  venueId: string;          // Venue identifier
  deviceId: string;         // Unique device ID
  status: 'active' | 'idle' | 'offline';
  lastHeartbeat: number;    // Timestamp (ms)
  expiresAt: number;        // Timestamp (ms) - 15s ahead
  userAgent: string;        // Browser info
  createdAt: string;        // ISO datetime
}
```

**Indexes:**
1. `venueId` (ASC), `status` (ASC), `expiresAt` (DESC)
2. `expiresAt` (ASC), `status` (ASC)

2. Kiosk shows "position in queue" → Player determines position
3. Priority tracks (paid) → Player plays before main queue

### With AppWrite

1. **Collections:** queues, player_instances
2. **Realtime:** Subscribe to queue changes
3. **Functions:** Future admin controls will use player_instances

### With YouTube

1. **IFrame API:** Load YouTube player library
2. **Embed Videos:** Play music videos
3. **Events:** Handle play/pause/ended/error
4. **Controls:** Disable default UI, use custom controls

## 🎯 Task 6 Preview

The next task (Player Real-time Sync) is **partially complete** because:

- ✅ usePlayerManager already implements AppWrite Realtime subscriptions
- ✅ Queue updates already sync in real-time
- ✅ Master election already implemented with heartbeat
- ✅ Now Playing updates via localStorage

Remaining for Task 6:
- Player state broadcast (playing/paused) across devices
- Enhanced master election conflict resolution
- Cross-device control signals
- Viewer endpoint integration

**Estimated:** 60-70% of Task 6 already done! 🎉
