# ⚠️ URGENT FIX: Magic Link Callback 404

## 🚨 **Problem**
Deployments are being auto-canceled by AppWrite (likely rate limiting or site configuration issue).

## ✅ **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Manual Console Configuration**

### **Step 1: Go to AppWrite Console**
```
https://cloud.appwrite.io/console/project-68cc86c3002b27e13947/sites/djamms-unified
```

### **Step 2: Configure SPA Settings**

Look for one of these options in the site settings:

**Option A: "Fallback File" Setting**
- Navigate to: Settings → Configuration or Advanced
- Find: "Fallback File" or "404 Page" or "SPA Mode"
- Set to: `index.html`
- Save changes

**Option B: "Adapter" Configuration**
- Ensure Adapter is set to: `static`
- Enable "SPA Mode" if available
- Set fallback to: `index.html`

**Option C: Manually Upload _redirects**
- Go to: Deployments → [Active Deployment]
- Look for file manager or settings
- Upload or configure `_redirects` file

## 🔧 **Alternative Approach: Wait and Retry Later**

AppWrite may be rate-limiting deployments. Wait 10-15 minutes, then try:

```bash
cd /Users/mikeclarkin/DJAMMS_50_page_prompt
appwrite sites create-deployment \
  --site-id "djamms-unified" \
  --code "apps/web/dist" \
  --activate true
```

## 📋 **What's in the Build (Ready to Deploy)**

```
apps/web/dist/
├── _redirects          ← SPA routing fix (24 bytes)
├── index.html          ← Main HTML (476 bytes)
└── assets/
    ├── index-*.css     ← Styles (12.75 KB)
    └── index-*.js      ← React app (203.73 KB)
```

**Total Size:** 286 KB  
**Includes:** Full magic link authentication with _redirects file

---

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

### **Before Fix (Current):**
```
User clicks magic link:
https://www.djamms.app/auth/callback?userId=...&secret=...

AppWrite serves:
❌ 404 Error Page ("The page you're looking for doesn't exist")
```

### **After Fix:**
```
User clicks magic link:
https://www.djamms.app/auth/callback?userId=...&secret=...

AppWrite serves:
✅ index.html (with 200 status)

React Router:
✅ Sees /auth/callback in URL
✅ Renders AuthCallback component
✅ Verifies userId and secret with AppWrite
✅ Creates session
✅ Redirects to dashboard

SUCCESS! ✅
```

## 🌐 **Root Domain Setup**

**In Porkbun Console:**
1. Go to: https://porkbun.com/account/domain/djamms.app
2. Click: URL Forwarding (or Redirects)
3. Add:
   - **From:** @ (or djamms.app)
   - **To:** https://www.djamms.app
   - **Type:** 301 Permanent
   - **Forward Path:** YES
4. Save

**Result:** `djamms.app` → `www.djamms.app` (automatic redirect)

## 📊 **Deployment Status**

| Deployment ID | Status | _redirects | Notes |
|---------------|--------|------------|-------|
| 68e7e3286103759a86e4 | ✅ Active | ❌ No | Current (has 404 issue) |
| 68e7eac21a308bc5b42d | ❌ Canceled | ✅ Yes | Auto-canceled by AppWrite |
| 68e7eb53e6793caf7e55 | ❌ Canceled | ✅ Yes | Auto-canceled by AppWrite |

**Possible Causes of Auto-Cancel:**
- Too many rapid deployments (rate limit)
- Site configuration issue
- Free tier restrictions
- Build timeout or error

## 🔄 **Next Steps (Choose One)**

### **Option 1: Manual Console Fix (FASTEST)**
1. Open AppWrite Console (link above)
2. Configure fallback file to `index.html`
3. Save and test magic link immediately

### **Option 2: Wait and Redeploy (15-30 minutes)**
1. Wait for rate limit to reset
2. Run deployment command again
3. Monitor until deployment completes

### **Option 3: Contact AppWrite Support**
If deployments keep getting canceled:
- Check AppWrite Discord/Support
- Ask about deployment cancellations
- May be a temporary platform issue

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

Once fix is applied:

- [ ] Visit: https://www.djamms.app/auth/callback  
  **Expected:** HTML page loads (not 404)

- [ ] Test magic link flow:
  1. [ ] Go to https://www.djamms.app/auth
  2. [ ] Enter email
  3. [ ] Send magic link
  4. [ ] Check email
  5. [ ] Click link
  6. [ ] **Authentication succeeds** ✅

- [ ] Test root domain:
  - [ ] Visit: http://djamms.app
  - [ ] Redirects to: https://www.djamms.app

## 📝 **Files Ready for Next Deployment**

```bash
# The build is ready with _redirects file
ls -la apps/web/dist/

# Output should show:
_redirects          (24 bytes)   ← SPA routing fix
index.html          (476 bytes)  ← Main HTML
assets/             (directory)  ← JS and CSS
```

---

## 🎯 **Summary**

**Problem:** Callback route returns 404  
**Root Cause:** AppWrite doesn't know to serve index.html for all routes  
**Solution 1:** Configure fallback file in AppWrite Console (manual, immediate)  
**Solution 2:** Deploy with _redirects file (automatic, once deployments work)  
**Status:** Build ready with _redirects, waiting for successful deployment
