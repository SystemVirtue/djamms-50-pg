# üö® URGENT: DEPLOY TO VERCEL NOW

## Critical Issue

You're still getting the **OLD wrong URL** in emails:
```
‚ùå https://djamms.app/auth/callback?secret=...
```

This proves the **frontend hasn't been deployed yet**.

## Why This Happens

The code fixes are in GitHub, but **Vercel is serving the OLD code**.

The magic link function reads `body.redirectUrl` from the frontend request:
```javascript
// Frontend sends wrong URL (old deployed code)
const magicLink = `${body.redirectUrl || 'https://auth.djamms.app/callback'}...`
```

## Solution: DEPLOY NOW

You **MUST** deploy the auth app to Vercel for the fix to work.

### Option 1: Check If Auto-Deploy is Running

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Look for recent deployments (should show commit "Fix auth routes")
3. If deployment is running, **wait for it to complete**

### Option 2: Manual Deploy (DO THIS IF NO AUTO-DEPLOY)

1. **Go to Vercel**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find the auth project** (deployed to `auth.djamms.app`)
3. **Click the project name**
4. **Go to Deployments tab**
5. **Click the ‚ãØ menu** on the latest deployment
6. **Click "Redeploy"**
7. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete

### Option 3: Deploy via CLI (Fastest)

```bash
cd /Users/mikeclarkin/DJAMMS_50_page_prompt

# Make sure you have latest code
git pull origin main

# Install Vercel CLI if needed
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy auth app
cd apps/auth
vercel --prod

# Follow prompts to deploy
```

## After Deployment

### 1. Verify Deployment

Check that new code is live:
```bash
# Check if callback route exists (should return 200)
curl -I https://auth.djamms.app/callback

# Should NOT return 404
```

### 2. Clear Browser Cache

**Important!** Old code may be cached:
- **Mac**: Cmd + Shift + R
- **Windows**: Ctrl + Shift + R
- Or use **Incognito/Private mode**

### 3. Test Magic Link

1. Go to https://auth.djamms.app (or https://djamms.app)
2. Enter email: `mike.clarkin@icloud.com`
3. Click "Send Magic Link"
4. **Check email** - URL should be:
   ```
   ‚úÖ https://auth.djamms.app/callback?secret=...
   ```
   **NOT**:
   ```
   ‚ùå https://djamms.app/auth/callback?secret=...
   ```
5. Click link - **should work!**

## Why You're Getting Wrong URL

The frontend code that **requests** the magic link includes the redirect URL:

```typescript
// apps/auth old code (not deployed yet):
await auth.sendMagicLink(email, redirectUrl);
// redirectUrl = window.location.origin + '/auth/callback' ‚ùå

// apps/auth new code (in GitHub, not deployed):
await auth.sendMagicLink(email, redirectUrl);
// redirectUrl = window.location.origin + '/callback' ‚úÖ
```

Until you deploy, the **old code** runs, sending the wrong URL to Appwrite.

## Quick Check: Is New Code Deployed?

```bash
# Download the live page source
curl -s https://auth.djamms.app | grep -o "callback" | head -5

# If you see lots of "callback" (not "auth/callback"), it's deployed
# If you see "auth/callback", old code is still live
```

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Go to Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Find auth project
- [ ] Check for auto-deployment of latest commit
- [ ] If no auto-deploy, click "Redeploy"
- [ ] Wait for "Ready" status
- [ ] Clear browser cache
- [ ] Test magic link flow
- [ ] Verify email URL is correct: `https://auth.djamms.app/callback`

## Expected Timeline

- **Deploy starts**: Immediately
- **Build time**: 1-2 minutes
- **DNS propagation**: Instant (same domain)
- **Test**: Immediately after "Ready" status

## What's Waiting to Deploy

**Commits on main branch (not yet deployed):**
1. `d8ae545` - Fix config fallback
2. `f00b112` - **Fix auth routes (CRITICAL)** ‚≠ê
3. `b658967` - Deployment guide
4. `2cf2fa0` - Complete fix summary

The key commit is `f00b112` which changes the routes from `/auth/callback` to `/callback`.

## If Still Getting 404 After Deploy

1. **Verify deployment succeeded**:
   - Check Vercel dashboard
   - Look for "Ready" status
   - Check deployment logs for errors

2. **Force refresh**:
   - Clear cache
   - Use Incognito mode
   - Or try different browser

3. **Check both URLs manually**:
   ```bash
   # New route (should work after deploy)
   curl -I https://auth.djamms.app/callback
   
   # Root (should work)
   curl -I https://auth.djamms.app/
   ```

## Summary

1. ‚úÖ Code is fixed in GitHub
2. ‚ùå Code is NOT deployed to Vercel
3. ‚è≥ **You need to deploy NOW**
4. ‚úÖ After deploy, magic links will work

The fix exists, it just needs to go live! üöÄ
