---

## 🔧 How to Fix

### Step 1: Access DNS Settings

**Where:** Your DNS provider where you added the records

**Options:**
- **Vercel:** https://vercel.com/settings/domains → djamms.app → Edit DNS
- **Porkbun:** https://porkbun.com → djamms.app → DNS Records
- **Other:** Check your DNS provider's control panel

### Step 2: Find the MX Record

Look for:
```
Type: MX
Host: send.djamms.app (or just "send")
Value: eedback-smtp.ap-northeast-1.amazonses.com  ← WRONG
```

### Step 3: Edit the MX Record

Change the value from:
```
eedback-smtp.ap-northeast-1.amazonses.com
```

To:
```
feedback-smtp.ap-northeast-1.amazonses.com
```

**Important:** Just add the missing 'f' at the beginning!

### Step 4: Save Changes

- Click Save/Update
- Wait 1-2 minutes for DNS propagation

### Step 5: Verify the Fix

```bash
dig send.djamms.app MX +short
```

**Expected output:**
```
10 feedback-smtp.ap-northeast-1.amazonses.com.
   ^^^^^^^^ Should have 'f' at the start
```

---

## ✅ After Fixing

### Wait for DNS Propagation (1-5 minutes)

DNS changes are usually fast, but can take up to 10 minutes.

### Verify the Fix

```bash
# Check the MX record is correct
dig send.djamms.app MX +short

# Should show:
# 10 feedback-smtp.ap-northeast-1.amazonses.com.
```

### Trigger Resend Verification

```bash
cd /Users/mikeclarkin/DJAMMS_50_page_prompt
node scripts/resend-setup.mjs --verify
```

**Expected output:**
```
🎉 SUCCESS!
Domain verified successfully!
Status: verified
```

### Test Email Sending

```bash
node tests/test-email-sending.mjs
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ PASS: Magic link created successfully
📧 ✅ Email sent successfully via Resend!
🎉 SUCCESS: Check mike@djamms.app for the magic link email!
```
